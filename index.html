  <h1>Introduction to C Programming</h1>
  <article>
    <h2>History and significance of C</h2>
    <p>C programming language was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It became popular due to its efficiency, flexibility, and portability. Many modern programming languages are influenced by C. C is often used for system programming, embedded systems, and low-level programming.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Characteristics of C</h2>
    <p>C is a procedural programming language with a structured approach. It provides low-level access to memory, making it suitable for system programming. C is also highly portable across different platforms.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Structure of a C program</h2>
    <p>A C program consists of one or more functions. The main() function is the entry point of a C program. Statements in C are terminated by a semicolon (;). Curly braces ({}) are used to define blocks of code.</p>

  <h1>Data Types and Variables</h1>
  <article>
    <h2>Integer types</h2>
    <p>C supports various integer data types such as int, short, long, and their unsigned counterparts. Sizes of these types may vary depending on the compiler and platform.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Floating-point types</h2>

  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Character types</h2>

  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Constants</h2>
    <p>Constants are fixed values that do not change during program execution. They can be of integer, floating-point, or character types.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>Variables are memory locations used to store data during program execution. They must be declared before use, specifying the data type.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Declaration and initialization</h2>
    <p>Variables are declared by specifying the data type followed by the variable name. They can be initialized during declaration using the assignment operator (=).</p>

  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Type qualifiers (const, volatile)</h2>
    <p>const qualifier specifies that a variable's value cannot be changed once initialized. The volatile qualifier indicates that the value of a variable can be changed unexpectedly by external factors, such as hardware.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h2>Storage classes (auto, register, static, extern)</h2>
    <p>Storage classes define the scope, visibility, and lifetime of variables. "auto" is the default storage class for local variables, "register" suggests the compiler to store a variable in a register for faster access, "static" maintains the variable's value between function calls, and "extern" declares a variable that is defined in another file.</p>
